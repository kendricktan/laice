        <h2>1. Create your first story</h2>
        <p>
            In order for Laice to classify the text you sent it, it needs some <i>context</i>. The <i>context</i> needed
            is stored in a <strong>Story</strong>. <strong>Stories</strong> can be made <a
                href="{% url 'stories_view' %}">here</a>.

        <h2>2. Establishing attributes</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Attributes</strong> are like <i>features</i> that Laice tries to identify within a sentence.
            For example, if you have two attributes: <code>name</code>, and <code>location</code> and you send it the
            sentence:
            <code>John is in London</code>, Laice will try and associate <code>{'name': 'John', 'location':
            'London'}</code> Of course this doesn't happen by magic and will require some training before Laice is able
            to do that, which is what we'll look into next!
        </p>

    <div>
        <h2>3. Added some examples</h2>
        <p>
            Laice isn't powered by black magic and will of course need some examples before it'll be able to
            automatically recognize attributes on its own. Start by entering some basic query examples for Laice to
            learn.

        <h2>4. Configuring your examples</h2>
        <p>
            Once you have a satisfiable amount of examples (5-10), start configuring where each attributes should
            belong to in a sentence. You can configure which attributes belong to which part of the sentence via the
            dropdown box.

        <h2>5. Train it!</h2>
        <p>
            Now that we have a sufficient list of examples to follow, simply click on the <i>Retrain model</i> button
            located at the top of your project.
        </p>

    <div>
        <h2>6. Test it!</h2>
        <p>
            Now simply go back to the <code>manual query</code> part of your story and insert a new sentence. Laice
            hopefully *fingers crossed* should be able to correctly label the key attributes of the new sentence. If it
            doesn't work then continue reading below.

    <div>
        <h2>6. Passing data through it!</h2>
        <p>
            You can now communicate with the server via a RESTful request. To do it with <code>Curl</code> execute:
            <pre>curl -X post -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"querystring": "Jack is in London"}' http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/stories/my-story-name/queries/</pre>
            <strong>Note</strong>: You might need to change <code>127.0.0.1:8000</code> to your server domain and <code>my-story-name</code> to your story's name.
            The <code>curl request</code> is also located at the very top of each of your story.
        </p>

        <h2>Help! My model isn't working! </h2>
        <p>
            Laice learns by examples, if it isn't able to classify your sentence correctly just reconfigure the sentence
            it got wrong via the dropdown buttons/delete buttons and hit the <code>retrain</code> button
        </p>
    </div>
